## Learnings

- While working on this project I had the chance to work on things I learnt in my firts week, such as:
  - `:root` to keep consistancy while using colors.
  - `flex` proprties such as `display: flex`, `flex-direction:`, `flex-wrap:`
  - `::selection` element
  - `:hover`
  - `text-transform`
  - `text-decoration`for `<a>` tags
  - `scroll-behavior` to add a smooth scrow to the anchor menu.
  - `Z-index:` to always keep the navbar absolute against other containers.
  - `<buttom>` tag.
  - `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, and `<text-area>` for my contact section.
